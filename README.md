# WSTHelper
Poorly made plugin to add !chat commands to cs2-surftimer

!reset, to reset to first stage
this should be working for surf_beginner, surf_utopia_njv, surf_mesa_revo, surf_kitsune
(spawn is hardcoded in plugin for these maps specifically so new maps or different spawn locations would have to be defined manually at this time)

!top will output top 5 times to chat
formatting is not pretty

unzip to /csgo folder 

requires metamod, counterstrikesharp, and cs2-surftimer

Install Metamod (https://cs2.poggu.me/metamod/installation/)
Install CounterStrikeSharp (https://docs.cssharp.dev/guides/getting-started/). 
Install cs2-surftimer (https://github.com/ws-cs2/cs2-surftimer)
